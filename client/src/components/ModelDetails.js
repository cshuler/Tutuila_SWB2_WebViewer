                        <p>The Island of Tutuila , located near 14° S and 170° W, is the main population center of American Samoa, and at 142 km2 is the third largest island in the Samoan Hot-Spot Island Chain. Due to its position within the South Pacific Convergence Zone, the island experiences abundant year-round rainfall, with increased precipitation during the wet season from October to May. Monthly average rainfall in the wet season is roughly twice that of the dry season’s still significant rainfall amounts.</p>
