# Tutuila_SWB2_WebViewer


Project Premise: 
The existing Oahu GW Recharge Viewer (OGWRV) is a valuable decision support tool. In American Samoa existing water budget models have been developed, but not yet been presented to the public and decision makers via an online format. Therefore we will modify the user-interface framework built for the OGWRV to be applied to create a valuable product to support water resource management in American Samoa.
